# slow_payers

In this project I trained a multi-layer perceptron neural network to predict if a new client will be a slow payer. For this prediction I used 3 input variables:
* Quantity: The total quantity of the loan.
* Labor seniority: The time the client has worked in their current job (in months)
* Salary ratio: The percentage of the Monthly income vs the monthly loan payment.

The output of the nn is only one boolean for if the person will be a slow payer or not: if 0 no, if 1 yes.

The nn is using 6 hidden neurons for the pattern finding.
